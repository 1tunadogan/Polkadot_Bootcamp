This code snippet is written in the Rust programming language. In this code, a function is defined named "calculate_length" which takes a borrowed reference to a String as a parameter. The purpose of this function is to calculate the length of the given string, which is done using the expression s.len().

In the main function, a String is created and a borrowed reference to this string is passed to the calculate_length function. As a result, the length of the string is calculated and printed to the screen.

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of borrowed references. Borrowed references are used to lend a value to another variable without transferring ownership. This reduces memory usage and improves runtime performance of the program.
